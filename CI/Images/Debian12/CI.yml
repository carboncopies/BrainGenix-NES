# Using Kaniko
# ------------

# Kaniko is the recommended method for running Docker-builds as of May 2019. 
# See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_kaniko.html for GitLab's documentation.
#
# N.B.: if using docker-image-build tag in the past, and passing arguments to the image at build time (such as BUILD_ARG_1:'MY_VAR=my_value'),
# consider checking https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko#flag---build-arg to pass arguments to the Kaniko executor.
