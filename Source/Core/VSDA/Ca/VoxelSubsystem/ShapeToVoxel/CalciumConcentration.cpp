/**
 * Some notes by Randal:
 * 
 * - I am implementing this function as requested, even though I have some doubts
 *   as to whether it is necessary or more efficient than just doing what I do
 *   within this function without storing the extra vector of vectors first and
 *   then pulling from that. After all, all the necessary data is already buffered
 *   in the neurons that this funtion obtains the data from.
 * - Alternatively, to get the calcium concentration of a particular component at
 *   a particular Ca sample time index. See the ComponentSampledCalciumConcentration()
 *   function below. That does precisely as many reads with exactly as many indirections
 *   and avoids building the extra vector of vectors buffer.
 *   Of course, that would be more CPU-taxing if you can't deal with all the voxels of
 *   one component at a time. Anyway, proving both methods for convenience.
